      <h1>Beatrice Kirkbright</h1>
      <p>Hi. I'm a senior design professional with 13 years in technology.
        <a href="https://beatricekirkbright.com/beach_Clean_Up_Game/beach_clean_up.html" target="_blank" class="tooltip">
          It all began with code<img src="img/beach_clean-up_game.png" alt=" a beach clean-up game designed and developed by Beatrice"/></a> 
        for me so I have held roles on both the development and design side. Most recently, I launched and lead a design system team and that is my primary interest - design systems and design leadership. My technical background has enabled me and my teams to deliver without the normal bumps around hand off of design or execution gaps.
      </p>  
      <p>I have tended to work on

        and

            <img src="img/logo-aon.svg" alt="Aon assessment solutions homepage: unfortunately all the products I've designed and built at Aon are considered IP."/>
        </a>  
        which have necessitated a large scale view to efficiency. Those experieces informed why I am passionate about and best suited to design system roles or anywhere there is a need to streamline or initiate conversation between development and design.
      </p>
      
      <p>I do love to get into the flow of coding or design very much still. By bringing development and design all at once I'm able to execute on the design either in 
        <a href="https://github.com/bzkny" target="_blank" class="tooltip">
          code<img src="img/github-bzkny.png" alt="Beatrice's Github handle."/></a>
        or 
        <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/T9bIGtY6bozUM12Elmn8yy/GG?type=design&node-id=124%3A3&mode=design&t=Xl6ZpPfY5zvgssY1-1" target="_blank" class="tooltip">figma/xd<img src="img/DS Palette - Dark Theme.svg" alt="A fictitious design created based on a style guide. Wireframe and branding through high fidelity prototype all created by Bea."/></a> 
        with an eye to what is practical and scalable. I am able to jump into the code and fix tiny pixel problems or large scale legacy code refactors, deep dive into componentization and the design systems built around them and enunciate, anticipate and fix most problems* that arise in the creation of a technical product... at least where the UI is concerned.
      </p>
        
      <p>When I'm not creating, I can be found on the tennis or squash courts, birdwatching, and
