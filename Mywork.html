        <p>I was at Aon for over 5 years. Here are some highlights:<br/> 
            <span>&#x21AA; </span>As the first design hire in a global billion dollar business, I set up the design function from the ground up.<br/><span>&#x21AA; </span>I planned and executed a re-design of the US assessment platform to mobile first with theme-ing. Which reduced the branding process from 3 month to 3 days.<br/><span>&#x21AA; </span>Created a successful pitch deck for Pepsi.<br/><span>&#x21AA; </span>Wrote a custom UI Kit for a total re-design of the complex b2b2c enterprise assessment platform which included: a CMS, theme-ing, accessibility and localization.<br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>I solved for those complexities by creating a design system including a component library and my UI Kit.<br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>Hired and manage a team to launch the design system to build out candidate reports.<br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>I managed our (global) team's, roadmap, planning, hiring, performance etc and was able to get delivery to 100% on time for that year. <br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>And we did it while creating bonds and engaging the whole team.<br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span> My final role was managing implementation and growth of the design system on three simultaneous projects: candidate reports, a new ESG platform, and a report engine for Aon globally. I was also on the team advising and implementing the Aon-wide design system.</a></p>

        <p>I was at Barclays for over 4 years so to briefly summarize: <br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>Primarily I was responsible for re-branding Barcalys Live. Not only had the former Lehman Live site not been updated according to Barclays brand guidelines, it hadn't had a refresh in the four years since the acquisition/financial crisis. <br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>The branding guidelines had only been created for print, so I converted those and augmented them into a digital suite for use across Barclays Live (e.g. navigation, tabs, links, pagination, buttons and their states). <br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>Out of that, I created the Barclays Live/Research style guide as well as new concepts such as analyst featured quotes, analyst and company equities pages. <br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>My homepage design was selected to go live and that design, among others has lasted 10 years and is put forward in the promotional material by Barclays to this day, which is why I am able to <a href="https://live.barcap.com/publiccp/RSR/nyfipubs/barcap/researchbrochure/img/equity-company-page.jpg" class="arrow-link">share it with you.</a></p>
