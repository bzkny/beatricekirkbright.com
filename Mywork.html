      <h1>The Past 13 Years</h1>
      <img src="img/logo-aon.svg" alt="Aon"/>
      <div class="summary">
        <p>I was at Aon for over 5 years. Briefly, here are some highlights:<br/> 
            <span>&#x21AA; </span>As the first design hire in a global billion dollar business, I set up the design function from the ground up.<br/>  <span>&#x21AA; </span>Next, I planned and executed a re-design of the assessment portfolio to be mobile first and enable theme-ing. I then refactored the UI legacy code to enable the same. The process to brand assessments for B2B sales was a purely manual one requiring design, dev, QA and took ~3 months. The refactor and re-design enabled B2B brandings in 1-3 days.<br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>I helped create a successful pitch deck for Pepsi based on the new themed designs.<br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>I was promoted to a global role from North America where I was able to architect new UI design infrastructure for a total re-write and re-design of the assessment platform. The scope included a CMS, theme-ing, accessibility and localization, which I solved for with a new design system built on storybook including a react component library and a UI Kit which I custom built. <br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>Seeing the value of the design system, I was put in charge of getting it off the ground in the context of a report application for the assessment team. I managed our (global) team's, roadmap, planning, hiring, performance etc and was able to get delivery to 100% on time for that year, a novelty in that business line. <br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span> Given the successful execution by the team on the assessment report project, my final role was managing a joint team of design and developers on the design system. I oversaw the implementation and growth of the design system on three simultaneous projects: a new ESG platform and a generic report application for Aon globally in addition to the report engine for Assessments. I was also on the team advising and implementing the Aon-wide design system.</a></p>

      <div class="summary">
        <p>I was at Barclays for over 4 years so to briefly summarize: <br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>Primarily I was responsible for re-branding Barcalys Live. Not only had the former Lehman Live site not been updated according to Barclays brand guidelines, it hadn't had a refresh in the four years since the acquisition/financial crisis. <br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>The branding guidelines had only been created for print, so I converted those and augmented them into a digital suite for use across Barclays Live (e.g. navigation, tabs, links, pagination, buttons and their states). <br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>Out of that, I created the Barclays Live/Research style guide as well as new concepts such as analyst featured quotes, analyst and company equities pages. <br/> <span>&#x21AA; </span>My homepage design was selected to go live and that design, among others has lasted 10 years and is put forward in the promotional material by Barclays to this day, which is why I am able to <a href="barclays.html" class="arrow-link">share it with you.</a></p>
