            <p>I was responsible for translating Barcalys brand guidelines which were largely only intended for print, into digital, branded assets for use across Barclays Live. While I didn't grab screenshots all those years ago; I can say my design has lasted 10 years and is put forward in the promotional material by Barclays to this day (which is why I am able to share it with you).</p>
            <p>I was at Barclays for four (4) years which, again, makes it difficult to summarize the full extent of the work I did but briefly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Page layout standardization</li>
                <li>Limited font and typography rules</li>
                <li>Consistent brand color meaning and rules </li>
                <li>Consistent spacing rules</li>
                <li>Creation of web/mobile specific designs such as tabs, navigation, links, icons, carousels with pagination and interactive tables.</li>
                <li>Ideation and adoption of new pages including Analyst profile pages</li>
                <li>Ideation and adoption of new design paradigms such as editorial type for special quotes, rotating dynamic content.</li>
                <li>I was later positioned within the dev team and was extremely hands on in the implementation particularly of the style guide.</li><li>While on the development side, operations and even legal made some "tweaks" to my original design. Such is design in finance.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

        which have necessitated a large scale view to efficiency. Those experieces informed why I am passionate about design system roles or anywhere there is a need to streamline or initiate conversation between development and design.
      </p>
      
      <p>I do love to get into the flow of coding or design very much still. By bringing development and design all at once I'm able to execute on the design either in 
        <a href="https://github.com/bzkny" target="_blank" class="tooltip">
          code<img src="img/github-bzkny.png" alt="Beatrice's Github handle."/></a>
        or

Wireframe and branding through high fidelity prototype all created by Bea."/></a> 
        with an eye to what is practical and scalable. I am able to jump into the code and fix tiny pixel problems or large scale legacy code refactors, deep dive into componentization and the design systems built around them and enunciate, anticipate and fix most problems* that arise in the creation of a technical product... at least where the UI is concerned.
