        <p>I was at Barclays for four (4) years which, again, makes it difficult to summarize the full extent of the work I did but briefly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Page layout standardization</li>
            <li>Limited font and typography rules</li>
            <li>Consistent brand color meaning and rules </li>
            <li>Consistent spacing rules</li>
            <li>Creation of web/mobile specific designs such as tabs, navigation, links, icons, carousels with pagination and interactive tables.</li>
            <li>Ideation and adoption of new pages including Analyst profile pages</li>
            <li>Ideation and adoption of new design paradigms such as editorial type for special quotes, rotating dynamic content.</li>
            <li>I was later positioned within the dev team and was extremely hands on in the implementation particularly of the style guide.</li><li>While on the development side, operations and even legal made some "tweaks" to my original design. Such is design in finance.</li>
        </ul>
